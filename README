=Compilation=
==Dependencies==
The demo application comming with the library needs the sfml rc0,
cmake, to compile.
==Steps==
  # Download sources
  # Go to the root directory
  # {{{ cmake CMakeList.txt -Wno-dev }}}
  # {{{ make }}}
  # {{{ ./bin/Release/falling_demo }}}

=Algorithms involved=
==Broad phase==
  * *Sweep & Prune* detector (so, AABBs) using space/time coherency;
  * *OBB tree* on non-convex polygon (one OBB by concave polygon of its convex decomposition).

==Narrow phase==
  * *GJK-hybrid* for collision detection & ligth penetrations;
  * *EPA* for bigger penetrations.

==Contacts solving==
  * *Impulse* based;
  * *Projected Gauss-Seidel* LCP solver.

==Misc==
  * *Islands*
  * Object/Island *sleeping*;
  * Handles any polygons (convex, concave, crossed).
